This repository contains a simple Python program demonstrating a common error in recursive functions: RecursionError. The factorial function works correctly for non-negative integers, but it throws a RecursionError when called with a negative input due to the lack of a proper base case to stop the recursion. The solution demonstrates how to fix the error.
